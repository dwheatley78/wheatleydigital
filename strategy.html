    <h1>Preparing for Success</h1>
    <p>
      At its core digital transformation is about change management, having a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, 
      understanding how to implement it and making sure the benefits are realised in both the short and longer term.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Our expertise in delivering "Discovery-based" digital transformation programmes, avoids the cost, quality and adoption issues that blight many traditional 
      transformation programmes.</p>
    <p>
      This iterative approach, constantly testing assumptions, refining solutions and involving the team from the outset, ensures 
      affordable solutions deliver value, fast!
    </p>
    <p style="clear:both;">
      The Leavitt diamond model shows how, in order to be successful, the interdependencies between technology, people and processes need to be actively managed. 
      These, along <a href="#Model">marketing</a> cosiderations when promoting a new digital capability externally, are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

    <div id=Task style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>Task</h2>
      <img src="images/design challenge.png" class="right_image smlscr_image">
      <p style="clear:left">
        A high-level objective for your discovery-based digital transformation journey is essential to provide context to the project.
        A well-defined design challenge, using the template shown, ensures the team have a clear understanding of what they are trying to achive and 
        enables them to judge how successful they have been in delivering it.
      </p>
      

      <p>Having set the design challenge the key is to then break down the behaviours that traditionally act as barriers to innovation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Conventionality</b>– Using conventional techniques to solve problems results in conventional solutions.  To be truly innovative new ways of working are needed. 
          Design thinking provides an approach to engage diverse voices from across the organisation to develop a rich understanding of the problem.</li>
        <li><b>Risk Adversity</b> – In a risk adverse culture the tendency is to kill off the novel and innovative ideas in favour of safer and better understood solutions.  Design thinking promotes a culture of experimentation and failing fast to ensure novel solutions get properly explored. </li>
        <li><b>Ownership</b>- An innovation won’t succeed unless the company employees get behind it. Design thinking provides a methodology to involve people in the process of generating ideas, winning support and ensuring ownership of the developed solutions.</li>
       </ul>
      <p>  
        This process, detailed in the book <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design" target="_blank">Value Proposition Design</a> by Alexander Osterwalder breaks this process into 5 phases.
        As experienced Design Thinking facilitators the <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> team can lead members of your team through a series of fun and engaging workshops, 
        to elicit user centric requirements, develop solutions that work and importantly ensure commitment to change from across the organisation.
      </p>      
      <ul>
        <li><b>Empathise</b> -  Immersion in the customer experience produces data, which is transformed into insights, </li>
        <li><b>Ideate</b> – Potential solutions are then explored</li>
        <li><b>Define</b>- These ideas are then consolidated and refined to define the critical success criteria.</li>
        <li><b>Prototype</b> – Examine the proposed solutions in more detail through the development of low fidelity models.</li>
        <li><b>Test</b> -  Using the models the team test the assumptions and better understand how users would interact with them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        An overview of how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> support digital transformation programmes through developing dedicated <a href="./production.html">applications</a> and <a href="./analysis.html">analytical</a> solutions   
        is provided on the relevant pages of this site.
        However, before tearing off, chasing new and exciting solutions it's key to understand the capabilities already being provided by your existing IT solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools form the backbone of most company data warehouse solutions.  The first step should always be to see if these systems can, 
        or could be developed to, provide the required capabilities. If you are interested in implementing a CRM and/or ERP capability, both <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, 
        provide very capable, but expensive solutions.  As an more affordable solution we recommend considering  <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibar</a> as a great open-source alternative.

    <div id= People style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>People</h2>
      <p>
        Any process is only as good as the people who operate it.  As your business becomes more digital the demands on your employees may change necessitating training to 
        enable them to adapt and excel in a new working environment.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to redefining existing roles a range of new capabilities will be required to deliver and sustain your digital transformation.
        While the long-term objective should be to develop these skills internally, you're probably going to need a hand to get started.
        With experienced practitioners across all 7 key digital transformation disciplines <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> offer a unique capability to both
        augment and coach your existing team.

    <div id = Model style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Business Model</h2>
      <img src="images/business_model.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:left;">
        A business model allows an organisation to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
        threats it has relative to existing and future competitors in the market.  When evaluating what your future "digitally enabled" 
        business model could look like it may be helpful to consider how a start-up would disrupt the existing business model through either:
      </p>        
        <ul>
          <li>Using digital technology to deliver the services you currently offer</li>
          <li>Fundamentally change the cost structure of the business free from the constraints of a legacy business.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With this in mind, business model innovation is then about building on your existing capability while leveraging technology to transform how value is delivered to your customers. 
          Your business model should also consider how this value will be promoted, delivered, and monetised and the resources and costs associated with providing that service. </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this process it is essential to constantly evaluate the proposed services, ensuring they continue to satisfy the 3 key tenants of innovation: 
          <ul>
            <li>Desirability - What do people desire?</li>
            <li>Viability - What can be financially justified?</li>
            <li>Feasibility - What is technically and organisationally possible?</li>
          </ul>

    <div id=Identity style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Identity</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">
        An often overlooked consideration when building Web Apps is ensuring the identity and brand 
        they present aligns with the company values you are trying to portray.  The three principal channels to present an identity through a Web App are:
      </p>
      <h4>Selecting a name</h4>
      <p>Web Apps require an address which people will use to access the service from their browser.   This can be achieved through any one of following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A website will normally use the subdomain <code>www</code> but alternative subdomains can be used with an existing domain name.  
          e.g.  <code>https://maps.google.com</code></li>
        <li>Alternatively, a subdirectory after the main domain can be used as in <code>https://www.google.com/maps</code></li>
        <li>The final option is to secure a dedicated top level domain name (TLD),  while a new <code>.com</code> may be difficult and expensive to obtain, 
          the recent growth of new TLD options such as <code>.digital</code> has increased the number of possibilities and allows you to explore more creative and descriptive options.</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Creating a logo</h4>
      <p>When building a Web App, the logo is the thing with which people will identify, it will feature prominently in the header of the website, on the user's 
        browser and as an icon on their home screen as well as supporting potential wider marketing campaigns. When selecting a logo there are four main principals 
        that should guide your selection: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Appropriateness - The logo should convey your brand message to the target audience.</li>
        <li>Simplicity - A minimal and simple logo tends to attract people more easily.</li>
        <li>Scalability - The logo design should work whether it is the size from a tiny favicon to a giant billboard.</li>
        <li>Timelessness - It takes time to gain brand recognition, so choose a design that will last. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Choosing a design system</h4>
      <p>
        A consistent look and feel across all the pages of your application improve the user experience and help develop an identity. Design systems such as 
         <a href="https://material.io/" target="_blank">Material Design</a>, developed by Google, establishes a standard for designing and creating websites 
         and forms a useful basis your application development.</p>

    <div id = Marketing style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Marketing</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Once up and running the challenge is then to get people to visit your site and to develop a better understanding how they interact with it, 
        informing future developments and optimising the user experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</b> - is the process of optimising websites so that they rank well on search engines through organic (non-paid) searches. 
          A search engine works by matching the user search query with relevant information in their index. Search platforms assess the appropriateness of a page through 
          assessing a variety of information including meta descriptions, titles, loading speeds links and keywords to determine the order in which the content will appear. 
          By structuring your site well, you can increase the likelihood of it being prioritise in the result.

        </li>
        <li><b>Web analytics</b> -  are a powerful tool allowing you to track website visitors to understand how they interact with your site, when they interact with it
           and basic demographic information.
