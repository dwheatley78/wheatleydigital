    <h1>Preparing for Success</h1>
    <p>
      At its core digital transformation is about change management, having a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, 
      understanding how to implement it and making sure the benefits are realised in both the short and longer term.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Our expertise in delivering "Discovery-based" digital transformation programmes, avoids the cost, quality and adoption issues that blight many traditional 
      transformation programmes.</p>
    <p>
      This iterative approach, constantly testing assumptions, refining solutions and involving the team from the outset, ensures 
      affordable, impactful solutions get delivered fast!
    </p>
    <p style="clear:both;">
      The Leavitt diamond model shows how, in order to be successful, the interdependencies between technology, people and processes need to be actively managed. 
      These, along with pertinent <a href="#Model">marketing</a> considerations, when delivering service innovation to customers, are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
    </p>

      <li><a href="#Task">Task </a>-  Focusses on the desired outcomes of the digital transformation and the process of eliciting and evolving requirements.</li>
      <li><a href="#Technology">Technology </a>– Considers both the adoption of standard business applications and the development of custom solutions to deliver new value propositions.</li>

    <div id=Task style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>Task</h2>
      <img src="images/design challenge.png" class="right_image smlscr_image">
      <p style="clear:left">
        A high-level objective for your discovery-based digital transformation journey is essential to provide context to the project.
        A well-defined design challenge, using the template shown, ensures the team have a clear understanding of what they are trying to achieve and 
        , once complete, enables them to judge how successful they have been in delivering it.
      </p>
      

      <p>Armed with a clear objective the next challenge is to then break down barriers that traditionally inhibit innovation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Conventionality</b>– Using conventional techniques to solve problems results in conventional solutions.  To be truly innovative new ways of working are needed. 
          Design thinking provides an approach to engage diverse voices from across the organisation to develop a rich understanding of the problem.</li>
        <li><b>Risk Adversity</b> – In a risk adverse culture the tendency is to kill off novel and innovative ideas in favour of safer and better understood solutions.  Design thinking promotes a culture of experimentation and failing fast to ensure novel solutions get properly explored. </li>
        <li><b>Ownership</b>- An innovation won’t succeed unless the company employees get behind it. Design thinking provides a methodology to involve people in the process of generating ideas, winning support and ensuring ownership of the developed solutions.</li>
       </ul>
      <p>  
        The book, <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design" target="_blank">Value Proposition Design</a> by Alexander Osterwalder, provides more detail of the 
        5 phases of the design thinking process. As experienced Design Thinking facilitators <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> can lead members of your team through these 
        phases in a series of fun and engaging workshops 
        to elicit user centric requirements, develop solutions that work and importantly ensure commitment to change from across the organisation.
      </p>      
      <ul>
        <li><b>Empathise</b> -  Immersion in the customer experience to develop empathy and an understanding of the users.</li>
        <li><b>Define</b> - These ideas are then consolidated and refined to define a clear problem statement.</li>
        <li><b>Ideate</b> – Potential solutions are then explored, challenging assumptions and looking at the problem from new angles.</li>
        <li><b>Prototype</b> – Examines the proposed solutions in more detail through the development of low fidelity models.</li>
        <li><b>Test</b> -  Using these models the team then test their assumptions to better understand how users would interact with the solution.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id=Technology style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        An overview of how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> support digital transformation programmes through the development of dedicated <a href="./production.html">applications</a> and <a href="./analysis.html">analytical</a> solutions   
        is provided on the relevant pages of this site.
        However, before tearing off chasing new and exciting solutions it's important to understand the capabilities already being provided by your existing IT systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools form the backbone of most company data warehouses.  The first step should always be to see if these systems can, 
        or could be developed to, provide the required capabilities. If you are interested in implementing a CRM and/or ERP system, both <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, 
        provide very capable, but expensive solutions.  As a more affordable solution we recommend considering  <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibar</a> as a great open-source alternative.
      </p>

    <br>
    <div id= People style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>People</h2>
      <p>
        Any process is only as good as the people who operate it.  As your business becomes more digital the demands on your employees may change.
        To support them in this transition it may be necessary to invest in training to 
        enable them to adapt and excel in a new working environment.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to redefining existing roles a range of new capabilities will also be required in order to deliver and sustain your digital transformation.
        While the long-term objective should be to develop these skills internally, you're probably going to need a hand to get started.
        With experienced practitioners across all 7 key digital transformation disciplines, <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> offer a unique capability to both
        augment and coach your existing team, ensuring you have to the required skills for both the short and longer term.

    <div id = Model style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Business Model</h2>
      <img src="images/business_model.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:left;">
        A business model allows an organisation to evaluate its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
        threats relative to existing and potential future competitors.  When evaluating what your future "digitally enabled" 
        business model should look like, it may be helpful to consider how a start-up would disrupt the existing business model through either:
      </p>        
        <ul>
          <li>Using digital technology to deliver the services you currently offer more effectively.</li>
          <li>Fundamentally change the cost structure of the business, free from the constraints of legacy processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With this in mind, business model innovation is about building on your existing capability, while leveraging technology to transform how value is delivered to your customers. 
          Your business model should also consider how this value will be promoted, delivered and monetised as well as  the resources and costs associated with providing that service. </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this process it is essential to constantly evaluate the proposed services, ensuring they continue to satisfy the 3 key tenants of innovation: 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Desirability</b> - What do people desire?</li>
            <li><b>Viability</b> - What can be financially justified?</li>
            <li><b>Feasibility</b> - What is technically and organisationally possible?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To find out more about business model innovation we suggest reading <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/books/business-model-generation" target="_blank">Business Model Generation</a> by Alexander Osterwalder.

    <div id=Identity style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Identity</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">
        An often overlooked consideration, when building Web Apps, is ensuring the identity and brand 
        they present align with the company values you are trying to portray.  
        We suggest you carefully consider each of the 3 key web identity channels, detailed below, when developing a new service to ensure the most impactful solution possible gets delivered:
      </p>
      <h4>Selecting a name</h4>
      <p>Web Apps require an address with which people can access the service from their browser.   This address should be both memorable and relevant and can be achieved through using one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>New top-level domain</b> - Securing a dedicated top level <code>.com</code> domain name (TLD) can be challenging and expensive, but 
          the recent growth of new TLD options such as <code>.digital</code> offer new possibilities and allows you to explore more creative and descriptive options.</li>

        <li><b>Subdomain</b> - A website normally use the subdomain <code>www.</code> but additional subdomains can be used to access your new service.  
          e.g.  <code>https://maps.google.com</code></li>
        <li><b>Subdirectory</b> -  a subdirectory from your existing  domain can also be used, as in <code>https://www.google.com/maps</code></li>
              </ul>


      <h4>Creating a logo</h4>
      <p>When building a Web App people will principally identify with its logo.  The logo will feature prominently in the header of the website, on the user's 
        browser as a favicon and as an icon on their home screens, it may even be used on marketing literature to promote your service. When selecting a logo there are four main principals 
        that should guide your selection: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Appropriateness</b> - The logo should convey your brand message to the target audience.</li>
        <li><b>Simplicity</b> - A minimal and simple logo tends to attract people more easily.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability</b> - The logo design should work whether it is the size from a tiny favicon to a giant billboard.</li>
        <li><b>Timelessness</b> - It takes time to gain brand recognition, so choose a design that will last. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Choosing a design system</h4>
      <p>
        A consistent look and feel across your application will improve the user experience and support your brand identity. Design systems, such as <a href="https://material.io/" target="_blank">Material Design</a>, 
        developed by Google, establishes principles, styles and guidelines to help users navigate your webpage effortlessly.

        Standardised icons, buttons and navigation components help to provide a familiar feel, while state management and 
        interactivity make controls feel tactile and responsive, while your brand can be supported through colour and typography theming.

    <div id = Marketing style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Marketing</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Once up and running the challenge is then to get people to visit your site and to develop a better understanding how they interact with it.
        This can then be used to inform future developments and optimise the user experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</b> - is the process of optimising websites so that they rank well on search engines through organic (non-paid) search. 
          A search engine works by matching the user search query with information ascertained from the site meta descriptions, titles, loading speeds, links and content keywords 
          to determine the order in which the content will appear. 
          By structuring your site well, you can increase the likelihood of it being prioritised in the result.

        </li>
        <li><b>Web analytics</b> -  are a powerful tool allowing you to track website visitors to understand who they are and how they interact with your site.
