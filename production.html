    <h1>Developing a Data Platform</h1>
    <p>
      Data analysis can provide rich insights for an organisation; however, the real value is only realised once these tools are made available to a wider user community. 
      It is estimated that only around 10% of machine learning models developed actually make it into production, and hence the real value is never realised. 
      The two main problems preventing wider adoption of analytical solutions are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Unreliable source data </b> - While manual collection and bespoke data preparation can support isolated analysis, a more robust data pipeline is required to allow an application to scale. 
        It is therefore essential to develop robust and validated data repositories to secure the data capture and preparation process for their longer-term success.
      </li>
      <li><b>Accessibility</b> – If the developed solutions are not accessible or intuitive to prospective users their true value will never be realised.
          Furthermore, when providing services directly to your customers, it is essential that the look and feel of the application match the company values you wish to portray.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/production_cats.png" class="center">
    <p>
      Web Applications provide the perfect solution to both these issues but in order to be successful it is essential that they satisfy the following 5 core requirements . 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Affordability</b> - Avoid expensive licence fees by using freely available open-source tools </li>
      <li><b>Maintainability</b> - Ensure code is well documented and written using popular, well supported languages</li>
      <li><b>Scalability</b> - It is essential that solutions can grow to support your longer-term aspirations</li>
      <li><b>Usability</b> - The user interface (UI) must be intuitive, engaging and provide the necessary data validation.</li>      
      <li><b>Security</b> - Ensure that the application stores data securely and provides robust access and permission management</li>

    </ul>


    <p>
      On this page we discuss the methodologies and tools used by <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> to develop effective applications that satisfy all of the above criteria.

      As with our <a href="./analysis.html">analytics</a> page, we also provide a <a href="#home-tiles">project portfolio</a> to show case solutions we have built and 
      a <a href="./skills.html">skills page</a> with links to a range of books, tutorials and articles to further your understanding of the topic.

      <h2>Designing an application</h2>
      <img src="images/MVC.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p>
        Web Apps can provide the required functionality and secure data access to a variety of users through their web browser. 
        The ability to avoid having to install specialist software on people's devices, allowing updates to be easily deployed and centralising the data store make 
        Web Apps the ideal solution to satisfy the requirement of most data platforms. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For simple analytical applications the <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> library enables web apps to be created entirely using Python
        without the need for separate front end web development, making them ideal for sharing analytical models amongst an internal team.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the majority of applications however, it will be necessary to develop a user interface using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        A Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, provides separation of concerns between three elements provides and gives an appropriate balance between complexity and control:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Model</b> - The backend that contains all the data logic.</li>
        <li><b>View </b> – The frontend or graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
        <li><b>Controller</b> – The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Our preferred web development framework for server-side applications is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
        Django is a Python library making integration with existing analytical / machine learning models it also provides built-in functionality such as admin panels, 
        file upload support, authentication, comment boxes, contact forms and app management which all significantly reduce the time and effort required to build robust 
        web applications.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances if can be beneficial to further separate the UI and data processing and storage element of the application using an Application Programming Interfaces (API's). 
        APIs allow a programme to be broken into distinct services that communicate with other services allowing the benefits of the seperate languages to be realised and
        developed in parallel with minimal risk of unintended consequences so long as the interfaces 
        between services are maintained. To support this approach Django also provides a versatile toolkit for constructing web APIs 
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend (client-side) functionality of web application is provuded using JavaScript for which a variery of frameworks exist to provide predefined functionality and templates to save developers a lot of time 
        The most popular Javascript framework at present is <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, developed by Facebook.  React creates a single page application populated using data transfered via requests to the Django backend.
        One of the strongest features of React is the focus on developing common, reusable UI components to deliver engaging and intuitive user interfaces and ensure consitancy across applications.

      <h2>Effective Development</h2>
      <img src="images/DevOps.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p>
        Equally as important as the applications construction are the processes used to build and deploy the service.
        In the last 10 years DevOps has established itself as the software industry best practice, combining cultural philosophies, methodologies, 
        and tools to develop and evolve applications faster and more reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its heart DevOps is about creating flow between the various process stages, represented by a figure of eight.
        Through improving communication and feedback, identifing issues early and automating processes where possible to provide the team the best possible chance of success.
      </p> 
      <p>We outline a few key concepts that should be understood, however for a more comprehensive account of DevOps practices refer to 
        <a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-devops-handbook/"  target="_blank">The DevOps Handbook</a>.
      </p>
      

      <ul style="clear:both">
        <li><b>Agile </b> – When operating in a development environment, where there is a high degree of uncertainty, traditional project management techniques don’t work.  Agile, as defined in more detail in the book
          <a href="https://www.scruminc.com/new-scrum-the-book/" target="_blank">Scrum The Art of Doing Twice The Work In Half the Time</a>, is an approach to project management 
          in which small 2-3 week sprints of activity are planned, each of which delivers a demonstrable package of capability.
        </li>
        <li><b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </b> - When developing a new application, it is key to produce something with just enough functionality to encourage users 
          to adopt the solution.  These users can then be used to support the iterative development of the application testing enhancements and enabling the developers to learn from the feedback received.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Version control systems</b> - Systems such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> provide a means of storing, sharing and tracking changes to source 
          code in a special kind of database. This repository is an invaluable source that needs to be protected from both catastrophic events and the casual degradation of 
          human error.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Code Formatting</b>  While software doesn’t care how the code looks, other developers who may have to work on it in the future 
          certainly do. When everyone is writing code that looks the same, it becomes easier to underand and ammend.  Using opinionated formatting tools 
          can  styling enforce rules to simplify the process of writing well structured code.</li>
        <li><b>Testing</b> - is fundamental to ensure good quality code is being written and allows changes to be quickly validated.  The main types of testing used are:
          <ul>
            <li>Unit Testing - refers to taking a component of a program and testing it in isolation, these tests can then be 
              automated to validate changes,  test dependencies and handling of edge cases.</li>
            <li>Functional Testing - checks the compliance of the overall system against a defined set of criteria. In other words, does the software do what it’s 
              supposed to do?</li>
            <li>Regression Testing - running previously written tests whenever a new change is introduced to confirm it continues to function as expected as it grows in 
              complexity and capability.</li>
          </ul>
          
           
          

        <li><b>Continuous integration</b> – is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, 
          after which automated tests validate the code quality.  A robust approach to integration ensures bugs are found quicker 
          and reduces the time it takes to validate and release software updates.</li>
        <li><b>MLOPS</b>– Extends the concept of DevOps to machine learning models where integration not only covers testing and validating code, but is now extended to test 
          and validate the data in the system, including the retraining and serving of models as required.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="Data_Architecture" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>Structuring your data</h2>
      <p>The objective of a good data architecture is to ensure that all the information required to run your business is accurate, consistent and accessible.
        The first step in this process is often ensure that key information is stored centrally instead of distributed across a variety of personal computers 
        and drives.  Storing raw data, of various formats, in its native form in one common location is known as a <b>Data Lake</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Having created a <b>Data Lake</b>, it will become apparent that different, contradictory, versions of the same data exist necessitating significant work
        to convert it into a format suitable for analysis. To manage this situation it is necessary to create a process to extract the data from multiple sources, 
        transform it into a cleaned format and load load it into a structured database, called a <b>Data Warehouse</b>.  This process of transforming the date so 
        that it is optimised for specific business purpose is commonly referd to as an ETL process.
      </p>
      <p>The problem arises, as new unstructured data needs to be ingested into the <b>Data Warehouse</b>. 
        The solution is build an application, as defined above, to collect and validate the data at the point of entry This data is then stored in a dedicated database, 
        known as a <b>Data Mart</b>, which in tern forms a component of the wider <b>Data Warehouse</b> capablity. Depending on the data requirements of the application the <b>Data Mart</b> 
        can be considered as either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Independent - Created by drawing from operational or external data sources normally used to capture business or customer data that would otherwise 
          reside with individuals and be inaccessible to the wider organisation.
        </li>
        <li>Hybrid - combines input from a <b>Data Warehouse</b>, operational systems and external systems</li>
        <li>Dependent - built by drawing data from the existing central warehouse generally used for isolated security and solo performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ultimately, the data being collected needs to be stored in a database; however, there are a variety of database types to choose from, each with their own 
        strengths and limitations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relational databases are the standard solution, providing a strict structure / schema, ensuring the data it contains satisfies aa predefined list of components, 
          easily accessible and significantly reduces the chance of errors.
        </li>
        <li>Non-relational databases are more forgiving in their structure. Instead of tables with columns and rows, they have collections of different 
          categories allowing records of varying shape to be stored. 

        </li>
        <li>Graph databases are a relatively new form of database that capture both the entities and relationships between the different data points. These databases 
          rose to prominence with the growth of network analytics, as used extensively by Facebook and Google. 
        </li>          
      </ul>
      <p>In terms of selecting a database to use we again look to satisfy the success criteria as originally outlined.  Our recommendation for nearly all applications is to use
        <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> which is a highly capable open-sourcedatabase that supports a wide variety of data types. It
        provides integrity controls to prevent invalid or orphan records and powerful indexing methods to optimise performance, advanced features such as full-text search 
         and the ability to store non-relational data such as JSON and XML formats which enables PostgreSQL to also satisfy the demands of all but the most speciallist applications.
      </p>
      <p>
         Both PostgreSQL and Neo4j can be easily integrated into your Django applications and form part of your wider <b>Data Warehouse</b> capability.
      </p>

      <div id="Hosting" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
        <h2>Choosing a Hosting Environment</h2>
        <p>There are fundamentally two types of hosting arrangement available.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Statically hosting</b> - enables web pages serve up the same page to HTML, CSS and JavaScript to all users who enter the site, in reality this is nothing more than a file store.
            As no processing is required on the server these pages are generally faster and can be hosted at minimal, or no, cost using a variety of service providers including our 
            favourite <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Dynamic hosting</b> - enables the processing of content and storage of data on the server.  Dynamic hosting can be provided on any corporate network or by a cloud 
          service provider.  If you already have an IT team  capable of setting up, configure and managing servers this option provides the 
          greatest flexibility.
        </p>
        
        <p>An alternative solution is to opt for a PaaS (platform as a service) offering a more managed, low configuration services, making it incredibly easy to get up and running 
          and provide total upfront transparency of the costs. Our favoured solution is to use <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, which comes with the added benefit of providing a “Free Tier” which, while 
          there are significant constraints in terms of speed and storage capacity, provides an ideal sandpit environment in which to demonstrate capability without commitment.
        </p>
