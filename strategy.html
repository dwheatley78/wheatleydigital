    <h1>Preparing for Success</h1>
    <p>
      At its core digital transformation is about change management, having a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, 
      understanding how to implement it and making sure the benefits are realised in both the short and longer term.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Our expertise in delivering "Discovery-based" digital transformation, avoids the cost, quality and adoption issues that blight many traditional 
      transformation programmes.</p>
    <p>
      This iterative approach, constantly testing assumptions, refining solutions and involving the team from the outset, ensures 
      affordable solutions deliver value fast!
    </p>
    <p style="clear:both;">
      Using the Leavitt diamond model as a framework, the interdependencies between technology, people and processes during a digital 
      transformation programme are considered in the sections below. Where applicable this analysis is then extended to include the interactions with customers and the associated  
      <a href="#Model">marketing</a> requirements when promoting a new capability externally.
    </p>

    <ul>
      
      <li><a href="#Task">Task </a>-  Focusses of the desired outcomes of the digital transformation and the process of eliciting and evolving requirements.</li>
      <li><a href="#Technology">Technology </a>– Considers both the adoption of standard business and custom developed applications in delivering new value propositions.</li>
      <li><a href="#People">People</a> – Represents the employees within the organisation and how their skills and expertise need to adapt to the new operating paradigm.</li>
      <li><b>Structure </b>– Defines the activities performed by employees, and how they interact with each other.</li>

    <div id=Task style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>Task</h2>
      <img src="images/design challenge.png" class="right_image smlscr_image">
      <p style="clear:left">
        A high-level objective for your discovery-based digital transformation journey is essential to provide context to the project.
        A well-defined design challenge, using the template shown, ensures the team understand what they are aiming for and enables them to judge their success.
      </p>
      

      <p>Having set the design challenge the key is to then break down the behaviours that traditionally act as barriers to innovation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Conventionality</b>– Using conventional techniques to solve problems results in conventional solutions.  To be truly innovative new ways of working are needed. 
          Design thinking provides an approach to engage diverse voices from across the organisation to develop a rich understanding of the problem.</li>
        <li><b>Risk Adversity</b> – In a risk adverse culture the tendency is to kill off the novel and innovative ideas in favour of safer and better understood solutions.  Design thinking promotes a culture of experimentation and failing fast to ensure novel solutions get properly explored. </li>
        <li><b>Ownership</b>- An innovation won’t succeed unless the company employees get behind it. Design thinking provides a methodology to involve people in the process of generating ideas, winning support and ensuring ownership of the developed solutions.</li>
       </ul>
      <p>  
        This process, detailed in the excellent book <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design">Value Proposition Design</a> breaks this process into 5 phases.
        As experienced Design Thinking facilitators the <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> team can lead members of your team, and potentially wider stakeholder community, 
        through a series of fun and engaging workshops, to elicit user centric requirements, develop solutions that work and importantly ensure commitment to change from across the organisation.
        
      </p>      
      <ul>
        <li><b>Empathize</b> -  Immersion in the customer experience produces data, which is transformed into insights, </li>
        <li><b>Ideate</b> – Potential solutions are then explored</li>
        <li><b>Define</b>- These ideas are then consolidated and refined to define the critical success criteria.</li>
        <li><b>Prototype</b> – Examine the proposed solutions in more detail through the development of low fidelity models.</li>
        <li><b>Test</b> -  Using the models the team test the assumptions and better understand how users would interact with them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        An overview of how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> support digital transformation programmes through developing dedicated <a href="./production.html">applications</a> and <a href="./analysis.html">analytical</a> solutions   
        is provided on the relevant pages of this site.
        However, before tearing off, chasing new and exciting solutions it's key to understand the capabilities already being provided by your existing IT solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools should form the backbone of most company data warehouse solutions.  The first step should always be to see if these systems can, 
        or could be developed to, provide the required capabilities. If you are interested in implementing a CRM and / or ERP capability, both <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, 
        provide very capable, but expensive solutions.  As an alternative more affordable open-source solution we recommend considering  <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibar</a>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id= People style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>People</h2>
      <p>
        Any process is only as good as the people who operate it.  As your business becomes more digital the demands on your employees may change necessitating training to 
        enable them to adapt and excel in a new working environment.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to redefining existing role a range of new capabilities will be required to deliver and sustain a digital transformation.
        While the long-term objective should be to develop these skills internally, you're probably going to need a hand to get started.
        With experienced practitioners across all 7 key digital transformation disciplines <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> offer a unique capability to both
        augment and coach your existing team to satisfy these roles.

    <div id = Model style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Business Model</h2>
      <img src="images/business_model.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:left;">
        A business model allows an organisation to evaluate its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
        threats, relative to existing and future competitors in the market.  When evaluating what a future "digitally enabled" business model could look like it may be helpful to consider 
        how a start-up would disrupt the existing business model through either:
      </p>        
        <ul>
          <li>Using digital technology to deliver the services you currently offer</li>
          <li>Fundamentally change the cost structure of the business free from the constraints of a legacy business.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          With this in mind business model innovation is then about building on your existing capability while leveraging technology to transform how value is delivered to your customers. 
          A business model should also consider how this value will be promoted, delivered, and monetised and the resources and costs associated with providing that service. </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this process it is essential to constantly evaluate that the proposed services, ensuring they satisfy the 3 key tenants of innovation: 
          <ul>
            <li>Desirability - What do people desire?</li>
            <li>Viability - What can be financially justified?</li>
            <li>Feasibility - What is technically and organisationally possible?</li>
          </ul>

    <div id=Identity style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Identity</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">
        A often overlooked consideration when building Web Apps to drive your digital transformation is ensuring the identity and brand 
        they present align with the company values you are trying to portray.  Whether the platform needs to be given an identity within the organisation or used to rebrand
         the company entirely key decisions need to be made:
      </p>
      <h4>Selecting a name</h4>
      <p>Web Apps require an address which people will use to access the service from their browser.   This can be achieved through any one of following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A website will normally use the subdomain <code>www</code> but alternative subdomains can be used with an existing domain name.  
          e.g.  <code>https://maps.google.com</code></li>
        <li>Alternatively, a subdirectory after the main domain can be used as in <code>https://www.google.com/maps</code></li>
        <li>The final option is to secure a new dedicated tope level domain name (TLD).  These are however difficult and potentially expensive to secure.  
          However in recent years the addition of new TLDs such as <code>.digital</code> or <code>.biz</code> have increased the number of available
          more creative and descriptive options.</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Creating a logo</h4>
      <p>When building a Web App the logo is the thing with which people will identify, it will feature prominently in the header of the website,on the users browser and as an icon on thier 
        home screen as well as supporting potential wider marketing campaigns.  
        When selecting a logo there are four main principals that should guide your selection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Appropriateness - The logo should convey your brand message to the target audience.</li>
        <li>Simplicity - A minimal and simple logo tends to attract people more easily.</li>
        <li>Scalability - The logo design should work whether it is the size from a tiny favicon to a giant billboard.</li>
        <li>Timelessness - It takes time to gain brand recognition, so choose a design that will last. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Design system</h4>
      <p>
        A consistant look and feel across all the pages of your application imporve the user experience and help develpp an identity. Design systems such as 
         <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>, developed by Google, establishes a standard for designing and creating websites 
         and forms a useful basis your application development.</p>

    <br>

    <div id = Marketing style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Marketing</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Once up and running the challenge is then to get people to visit your site and to develop a better understanding how they interact with it, 
        informing future developments and optimising the user experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</b> - is the process of optimising websites so that they rank well on search engines through organic (non-paid) searches. 
          A search engine works by matching the user search query with relevant information in their index. Search platforms assess the appropriatness
          of a page through assesing a varierty of information including meta descriptions, titles, loading speeds links and keywords 
          to determine the order in which the content will appear.  
          By structuring your site well, you can increase the likelihood of it being prioritise in the result.
          <p>For more information check out the Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide">SEO starter guide</a></p>

        </li>
        <li><b>Web analytics</b> -  are a powerful tool allowing you to track website visitors to understand how they interact with your site, when they interact with it
           and basic demographic information.
