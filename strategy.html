    <h1>Preparing for Success</h1>
    <p>
      At its core digital transformation is about change management, having a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, 
      understanding how to implement it and making sure the benefits are realised in both the short and longer term.  
    </p>

    <iframe class="smlscr_image left_image" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/5iDJVSPMROpevax93ttA2v?utm_source=generator&theme=0" frameBorder="0" height="160" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

    <p>
      While it can be tempting to launch a wholesale redesign of your business this approach is both costly and fails to address the human aspects of change.  
      Adopting a discovery based digital transformation, as discussed in the podcast, provides an iterative approach, testing assumptions and refining 
      the solutions to ensure your realise the results required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this proess it's key to remember that digital transformation is not just about the technology, as Leavitt’s Diamond Model illustrates the interdependencies 
      of technology, structure, task, and people mandate a more holistic approach in order to realise the benefits. 
    </p>

    <img src="images/leavitt.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
    

    <p>In the context of a digital transformation programme the four elements included in Leavitt’s model are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Technology </b>– Both standard business applications and bespoke software and models used to enhance the company capabilities.</li>
      <li><b>Task </b>-  The desired outcomes of the digital transformation and the iterative capabilities that will be developed to get there.</li>
      <li><b>People </b>– The employees in the company and the expertise, knowledge and skills they possess.</li>
      <li><b>Structure </b>– The activities performed by employees the departments and hierarchies in the organisation and how they interact with each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where the digital transformation is targeted at developing the services offered to customer’s additional consideration as to the associated business model and branding should also be considered.

      <h2>Technology</h2>      
      <p>
        Before tearing off chasing new adn exciting systems its key to understand the capabilities being provided by the companies core it solutions. Typically a company
        would use customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools as the backbone of most company data warehouse. 
        The first step should always be to see in these systems have, or could be developed to provide the required data.  If it does then the first approach should be to utilise this source.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a myriad of comprehensive solutions on the market, including offerings from <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, 
        however these can quickly get expensive so it is worth considering open source alternative, for which our favourite is <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/">Dolibar</a>.
        Once in place it is usual to need a capablity within your team to act as the Data Stewards, defined later, who is responsible for ensuring data quality is maintained and 
        allowing data to be extracted for ingestion and processing in analytical applications.

      <p>
        Despite the strength of these systems they usually fail to capture all the required data, especially if you are working at a more business process level.
        If this is, where you find yourself a core part of your digital transformation journey will be to establish a company data warehouse.  
        In the Productionise sections of this site we introduce some of the key considerations when building this capability.

      <h2>Task</h2>
      <img src="images/design challenge.png" class="right_image smlscr_image">
      <p style="clear:left">While we promote the idea of discovery based transformation, iteratively developing and testing capabilities to build an overall capability, it is important to frame these against a higher level objective. 
        Without a well-defined design challenge, it’s hard for the team to know what they are aiming for or to judge how successful they have been.
      </p>
      
      <p>From which a design challenge can be formulated along the lines of:</p>
      
      

      <p>Having set a design challenge the work of the team is to identify how this could be achieved and develop an innovative solution.  Design thinking is an approach 
        to break down traditional human behaviours that can present a barrier to innovation, which include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Conventionality</b>– Using conventional techniques to solve problems results in conventional solutions.  To be truly innovative we need to find new ways of working. Design thinking provides an approach to engage diverse voices to develop a rich understanding of the problem.</li>
          <li><b>Risk Adversity</b> – In a risk adverse culture the tendency is to kill off the novel and innovative ideas in favour of safer and better understood solutions.  Design thinking promotes a culture of experimentation and failing fast to ensure novel solutions get properly explored. </li>
          <li><b>Ownership</b>- An innovation won’t succeed unless the company employees get behind it. Design thinking provides a methodology to involve people in the process of generating ideas, winning support and ensuring ownership of the developed solutions.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Design thinking provides a range of techniques to develop and test assumptions from a users perspective.  Iterating through the 5 phases shown below</p>

      <img src="images/design_thinking.png" class="center">


        <ul>
          <li><b>Empathize</b> -  Immersion in the customer experience produces data, which is transformed into insights, </li>
          <li><b>Ideate</b> – Potential solutions are then being developed</li>
          <li><b>Define</b>- The insights are then consolidated and refined to define the critical success criteria.</li>
          <li><b>Prototype</b> – Examines these proposed solutions through the development of low fidelity models.</li>
          <li><b>Test</b> -  Using the models teams can test the assumptions and better understand how users would interact with the solution.</li>
        </ul>
        
      <p>In summary, the design-thinking process overcomes traditional barriers to creativity and enables superior solutions to be realised. Involving a diverse group of stakeholders in a fun and engaging process to define the problem and the development of solutions, helps to develop commitment to change across the organisation.</p>

      <h2>Key skills / Roles</h2>
      <p>
        There are 7 key roles that need to be satisfied in order to successfully deliver and sustain a digital transformation.
        While we believe your long term objective should be to develop these capabilities internally you're probably going to need a hand to get started.
        With experienced practitioners across all digital change management disciplines <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> offer a unique capability to both
        augment and coach your existing team.
      </p>
      <p>The key roles we consider essential to your success are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Transformation Leader / Product Owner</b> - Digital transformation is a business-model reinvention, it requires different functions across the organization to work 
          together in new ways. The key role for the transformation leader is to identify the strategic goals of the programme and driving the cross organisational
           changes required to fully realise the benefits digital technologies can deliver. 
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Data Steward</b> - Ensure there is a clear policy regarding where data is held and that it accurate, complete and up to date.

        <li><b>Design thinking workshop facilitation / System Analyst</b> - Lead collaborative working sessions that utilize design thinking practices and techniques
          to define and test a user story. These low fidelity requirements are then refined to provide a more detailed proposal that enable a technical solution to be developed.</li>
        
          <li><b>DevOps Engineers / Application Developers</b> - Individuals capable of building applications and data pipeline in accordance of the defined 
          data architecture rules to deliver the requirements as specified by the system analyst. </li>
        
          <li><b>Data Scientists / Analyst</b> - While Data Scientists are generally a dedicated resource capable of performing complex processing of data and development of 
            advanced mathematical and machine learning models.  
          While an analysts can generally will work within a function developing dashboard using low code Business intelligence tools</li>
        
          <li><b>Scrum Master / Agile Project Manager</b> -  Responsible for ensuring the team follows agile processes and practices, establishing an environment where the team 
          can be effective, clearing obstacles and protecting the team from outside interruptions and distractions.</li>
        
          <li><b>Process / Application Owner</b> - Either the principal user or able to represent the users interests, consolidating feedback, informing design decisions and 
          evaluating the suitability  of the developed solutions.

      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Business Model</h2>
      <img src="images/business_model.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:left;">A business model allows an organisation to evaluate it’s health in the market to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
        threats (SWOT).  It can be helpful to consider how a start-up would disrupt the existing business model through either:
      </p>        
        <ul>
          <li>Using digital technology to deliver the services you currently offer</li>
          <li>Fundamentally change the cost structure of the business free from the constraints of a legacy business.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>Business model innovation is then about leveraging the technology to transform how value is delivered to customers, how this value will be promoted, delivered, and monetized and the resources and costs to provide the service. </p>
        <p>Throughout this process it is essential to constantly evaluate that the proposed services satisfy the  3 key tenants of innovation.</p>          
        <p>These concepts, supported with real with case studies and suggested templates are provided in the book Business Model Generation.

      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Identity</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">The final, and much overlooked consideration when using WebApps to drive a digital transformation is ensuring the identity and brand 
        your application presents aligns with the company values.  Whether the platform needs to be given an identity within the organisation or the digital transformation 
        programme used as an opportunity to rebrand the company entirely are key decisions that need to be made.  In the context of a WebApp there are 3 main considerations:
      </p>
      <h4>Selecting a name</h4>
      <p>The WebApps you create will need to have an address which can be achieved through any one of following three options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A website will normally use the subdomain www but alternative subdomains can be used with an existing domain name to provide a dedicated web address.  
          A good example of this is  <code>https://maps.google.com</code></li>
        <li>Alternatively a subdirectory after the main domain can be used as in <code>https://www.google.com/maps</code></li>
        <li>The final option is to secure a dedicated domain  however it can be difficult and expensive to secure a desirable ".com" top level domain (TLD).  In recent years the addition of new TLDs such as .digital or .biz increases the available options to be more creative and descriptive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whatever the solution you are looking for the name you choose needs to be memorable and aligns with the brand you are trying to create.</p>

      <h4>Creating a logo</h4>
      <p>When building a WebApp the logo is the thing with which people will identify, it will feature prominently in the header of the website, in the tab on the browser and as an icon when creating links on the users home screen.  When looking to extend the application into the customer community the logo may also be required to support wider marketing of the capability.  When selecting the a logo there are four main principals that should guide your selection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Appropriateness - The logo should convey your brand message to the target audience.</li>
        <li>Simplicity - A minimal and simple logo tends to attract people more easily.</li>
        <li>Scalability - The logo design should work whether it is the size of a favicon in the tab bar of your browser or being used on a giant billboard.</li>
        <li>Timelessness - It takes time to gain brand recognition, frequently changing your identity can damage trust so choose a design that will last. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whatever the solution you are looking for the name you choose needs to be memorable and aligns with the brand you are trying to create.</p>
      
      <h4>Design system</h4>
      <p>Design systems contain style guide information setting colours, typography, and styles used throughout the user interface (UI). The collection of standards, principles and common UI elements ensure you create a consistent feel across all applications.  Material Design (https://material.io/) ,developed by Google, establishes a standard for designing and creating websites and apps with the aim of bringing order to design styles and form a useful basis for application development.</p>

      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Digital Marketing</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Once up and running the challenge is then to get people to visit your site and to develop a better understanding how they interact with it so that
        to inform future developments and optimise the user experience. Topics to be discussed in the sections include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</b> - is the process of optimising websites so that they rank well on search engines through organic (non paid) searches. 
          When someone performs a search on the internet, the serach engine algorithm matches the user’s search query to the relevant information in their index, 
          providing searchers with an accurate answer to their query. The platforms then use hundreds of signals including page loading speeds, meta descriptions and titles, links and keywords 
          to determine the order in which the content will appear for each searcher.  By structuring your site well you can increase the liklihood of it being prioratise in the result.
        </li>
        <li><b>Web analytics</b> -  Allows you to track website visitors quickly, without a lot of manual work using a tool like <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/" >Google Analytics</a>:
          <ul>
          <li>How well does the respondent audience in your web visits correspond to your target audience?</li>
          <li>What traffic sources yield the most valuable customers, not just one-time conversions?</li>
          <li>How can you enable colleagues to use and benefit from your website data?</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
