    <p>
      Digital service transformation is about exploiting technology to redefine your business model, accentuating your strengths, overcoming weaknesses, exploiting opportunities and 
      mitigating threats to deliver a competitive advantage.  When evaluating what your future "digitally enabled"  business model should look like, try considering how a start-up would 
      disrupt your existing market through either:
    </p>        
    <ul>
      <li>Using digital technology to deliver the services you currently offer more effectively.</li>
      <li>Fundamentally changing the cost structure of the business, free from the constraints of legacy processes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/business_model.png" alt="business model"class="smlscr_image right_image">
    
    
    <p>
      Whether your service transformation aims to enhance internal processes, or offer new capabilities to your customers, it is essential to constantly check that the 3 key tenants of 
      innovation are being satisfied: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Desirability</b> - What do customers and internal business users want?</li>
      <li><b>Viability</b> - What can be financially justified both independently and in support of wider business objectives?</li>
      <li><b>Feasibility</b> - What is technically and organisationally possible?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The sections below outline the <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> approach to developing effective digital service transformation strategies.

    <h3 class="accordion">Service Design</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>
      <p>
        Service design looks at the processes you and your customer’s experience, and try to optimize them to reduce friction, cost, and increase efficiency and quality.  
        To help define a journey to deliver the required capabilities ITIL provides a framework to describe how the components and activities of an organization work together 
        as a system to enable value creation, which include: 
      </p>
      <img src="images/ITIL.png" alt="ITIL model" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Plan–</b> ensure a shared understanding of what your service-provider organization needs to achieve, plus how.</li>
        <li><b>Engage–</b> engagement with stakeholders to achieve an understanding of their needs and to ensure that these needs are being met.</li>
        <li><b>Design and transition–</b> creation of new/changed services that meet stakeholder expectations across quality, cost, and time to market.</li>
        <li><b>Obtain/build–</b> creation of service components, also ensuring that they’re available when and where they’re needed and that agreed specifications are met.</li>
        <li><b>Deliver and support–</b> ensure that services are delivered and supported according to agreed stakeholder specifications and expectations. </li>
        <li><b>Improve–</b> ensure the continual improvement of products, services, and practices</li>
          
      </ul>
      
    <p>
      We outline how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> can help build your digital capability in the <a href="./production.html"> Productionise </a> and <a href="./analysis.html"> Analyse</a> 
      pages of this site.  However, the key to a success is ensuring you are tackling the right issues, engaging the team and driving adoption of the developed services. Some of the key considerations in the planning and engagement phases include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be clear what is the challenge that needs to be addressed.  Define clear success criteria to ensure that the developed solutions remain focussed on delivering real value to the business.</li>
      <li>Actively involve the team, not just the project sponsor, to gain a rich understanding of their issues and involve them in defining solutions to overcome the adoption issues that blight many traditional transformation programmes.</li>
      <li>Documenting and sharing a dictionary of terms to remove any ambiguity or misunderstanding across the team.</li>
      <li>Ensure a clear understanding of how the developed solution integrates with existing customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP). If you are interested in implementing a CRM and/or ERP system, 
        both <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, 
        provide very capable, but expensive solutions. As a more affordable solution we recommend <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibar</a> a great open-source alternative.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> we pride ourselves in our ability to deliver value through working with your team, develop the services they need.  We believe this value will drive new demand to create new and extend existing 
      services through an enduring partnership of co-created value.

    <h3 class="accordion">Driving innovation</h3>
      <div class="panel">
        <br/>
        <img src="images/design challenge.png" alt="design challenge" class="right_image smlscr_image">
        <p style="clear:left">
          To frame the objective of your service transformation programme we suggest writing a well-defined design challenge, using the template shown. 
          This design challenge ensures that developed solutions are based on a solid understanding the needs of the user.  We then use a process of "Design Thinking" to break down the 
          traditional barriers to innovation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Conventionality</b>– Using conventional techniques to solve problems results in conventional solutions.  To be truly innovative new ways of working are needed. 
            Design Thinking provides an approach to engage diverse voices from across the organisation to develop a rich understanding of the problem to be addressed.</li>
          <li><b>Risk Adversity</b> – In a risk adverse culture the tendency is to kill off novel and innovative ideas in favour of safer and better understood solutions.  Design thinking promotes a culture of experimentation and failing fast to ensure novel solutions get properly explored. </li>
          <li><b>Ownership</b>- An innovation won’t succeed unless the company employees get behind it. Design Thinking provides a methodology to involve people in the process of generating ideas, winning support and ensuring ownership of the developed solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>  
          The book, <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design" target="_blank">Value Proposition Design</a> by Alexander Osterwalder breaks the Design Thinking Process into 5 discrete phases and proposes a range of techniques to be used. 
          As experienced Design Thinking facilitators <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> can lead members of your team through these 
          phases in a series of fun and engaging workshops 
          to elicit user centric requirements, develop solutions that work and importantly ensure commitment to change from across the organisation.
        </p>      
        <ul>
          <li><b>Empathise</b> -  Immersion in the customer experience to develop empathy and an understanding of their needs.</li>
          <li><b>Define</b> - These ideas are then consolidated and refined to define a clear problem statement.</li>
          <li><b>Ideate</b> – Potential solutions are then explored, challenging assumptions and looking at the problem from new angles.</li>
          <li><b>Prototype</b> – Examines the proposed solutions in more detail through the development of low fidelity models.</li>
          <li><b>Test</b> -  Using these models the team then test their assumptions to better understand how users would interact with the solution.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion">Experiment and learn</h3>
      <div class="panel">

      <img src="images/BML-Loop.png" alt="build model learn" class="smlscr_image right_image" style="width:350px">

          <p>The process of testing assumptions with users and validating that the proposed solution meets their requirements doesn't stop with the creation of a prototype. 
            In his book, <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> Eric Ries describes a process, that aligns well with the discovery-based 
            digital servce transformation philosophy.  He suggests, when building a new product or service you should start with a minimum viable product (MVP), providing just enough functionality to 
            encourage a small cohort of users to adopt 
           the solution and then, with these "early-adopters" a cycle of designing experiments, testing hypotheses, measuring the response, and learning from the results, 
           referred to as a "Build-Measure-Learn" loop, is defined.  As the results come in from these experiments you can then evaluate the appropriate course of action, either: 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Persevere</b>: Your hypothesis was correct, so you decide to press on with the same goals. You repeat the feedback 
                loop to continuously improve and refine your idea.
              </li>
              <li><b>Pivot</b>: The experiment has refuted your hypothesis, but you've still gained valuable knowledge about what doesn't
                work. You can reset, or correct your course and repeat the loop, using what you've learned to test new hypotheses and carry out different experiments.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p> 
            Through repeating this loop and continuously evaluating how to respond you are able quickly iterate and refine your offering, 
            enabling you to cost-effectively deliver precisely what your users want. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Web analytics provide a powerful tool to track user activity on your site and develop a rich understanding of their interactions. 
             A/B testing is then a way to perform experiments, offering subtly different experiences to different cohorts of users and looking 
            for statistically significant differences between them to help shape the optimum solution. 
            Google provides a range of tools that simplify the process of monitoring user behaviour and performing experiments, check out the 
            <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/" target="_blank">Analytics Academy</a> website for more information.

      <p>
        Any process is only as good as the people who operate it.  As your business becomes more digital the demands on your employees may change.
        To support them in this transition it may be necessary to invest in training to 
        enable them to adapt and excel in a new working environment.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to redefining existing roles a range of new capabilities will also be required in order to deliver and sustain your digital service transformation.
        While the long-term objective should be to develop these skills internally, you're probably going to need a hand to get started.
        With experienced practitioners across all 7 key digital service transformation disciplines, <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> offer a unique capability to both
        augment and coach your existing team, ensuring you have to the required skills for both the short and longer term.
