    <h1>Generating Value Through Actionable Insights</h1>
    <p>Analytics is the art of converting data into information with the power to transform how your business operates.</p>  
    <p>These capabilities can be categorised as:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Descriptive</b> - Generally delivered through a dashboard, descriptive analytics enable you report on what has happened.</li>
        <li><b>Diagnostic</b> - Leveraging statistical analysis diagnostics enable you to better understand the root cause of an event.</li>
        <li><b>Predictive</b> - Predictive analytics uses historic data to forecast what is likely to occur in the future.</li>
        <li><b>Prescriptive</b> - Taking this a step further, prescriptive analytics suggest the optimal action to be taken to achieve a desired outcome.</li>
        <li><b>Cognitive</b> - Taking the human out of the loop, cognitive analytics learn what actions to take to achieve a stated objective based on defined reward mechanism.</li>

    <h3 class="accordion">Business intelligence</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Typically used for more straightforward querying and reporting of data, business intelligence tools combine data from a broad range of sources 
        to report business metrics via intuitive dashboards. These professional looking reports, that can be generated with little, or no, knowledge of coding provide a great way 
        to enable data driven decision making across your organisation and democratise your analytical capabilities. Popular business intelligence solutions include Microsoft's 
        <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-gb/">PowerBI</a> and <a href="https://www.tableau.com/en-gb">Tableau</a> produced by Salesforce.

    <h3 class="accordion">Mathematical modelling</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Mathematical modelling covers a variety of techniques, all of which are fundamentally about building a representation of the provided data 
        with which to conduct analysis and infer relationships between variables. The 5 key mathematical modelling disciplines we consider are: 
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)</b> -  By defining the variables, constraints and objective function of a problem the MILP algorithms identify the optimum solution 
            for a given problem. The <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a> web site provides some fascinating case studies where MILP has been used to great effect and, at a 
            significant cost, is probably the most capable optimisation software available. Open-source Python alternatives such as <a href="http://www.pyomo.org/">Pyomo</a> and 
            <a href="https://scipy.org/">Scipy</a> can provide similar capabilities, without the expense.</li>
          
          <li><b>Econometrics</b> - The goal of econometrics is to understand cause-effect and statistical significance of relationships, often within the scope of policy evaluation.  
            This information is invaluable when seeking to support recommended actions with empirical evidence.  Our preferred Python library when performing econometric analysis 
            is <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/index.html">statsmodels</a>
          </li>
          <li><b>Network Analytics</b> - Networks, or graphs, provide a way to infer the level of connectivity and influence between objects.  Examples of these objects include, people, 
            companies in a supply chain and transport networks as exploited by the Google search engine, Facebook social network and various satnav route planning services.  
            <a href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a> is an intuitive Python package with which to create and study networks but for larger scale analysis a dedicated Graph database, such as <a href="https://neo4j.com/">
              neo4j</a>, provide significant performance benefits. 
          </li>
          <li><b>Time series analysis </b> - Involves using ARIMA and ETS techniques to project forward the observed seasonality and underlying trends in a dataset to predict future events.  
            Again, our preferred Python library for performing this type of analysis is <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/index.html">statsmodels</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Discreet Event Simulation</b> - Sometimes the best way to understand a phenomenon is to build a simulation. Running the simulation with a range of statistically controlled 
            input parameters and performing a Montecarlo analysis to determine the likelihood of a variety of outcomes.  Once understood optimisation algorithms can be applied to select 
            the best mitigating actions to be taken.  <a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/">Simpy</a> is a popular Python simulation library, although we generally prefer developing
            custom objects and generator functions to define a simulation environment and behaviours of actors within it. 
          </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion">Machine learning techniques</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Machine learning algorithms are used to predict an output value or classify an object based on the provided input variables. In contrast with mathematical modelling machine learning 
        focuses on making the best fit, not in understanding the underlying causality.  The main Python library for machine learning is <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">Sci-kit learn</a>, which enables
        a wide variety of machine learning algorithms to be trained and fitted to a given dataset, as well as providing pre-processing techniques and methods for comparing and validating parameters to simplify the process of selecting the model
        that gives the best results.
      </p>
             
      <img src="./images/machine_learning_map.png" class="center">
      <p>As shown in the above diagram, machine learning algorithms can be divided into 4 distinct categories.</p>
      
      <b>Supervised learning</b> - Covers models in which a labelled datasets is used to train algorithms to either classify or predict output values of a given dataset. 
        As input data is fed into the model an error function serves to evaluate the quality of the model prediction and adjusts the weights accordingly to reduce 
          the discrepancy. The algorithm then repeats this evaluation and optimisation process, updating weights until an accuracy threshold  has been satisfied.  
          Once derived, these model weights can then be applied to a previously unseen dataset to allow output predictions to be made.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Classification</b> - These algorithms are used to identify which category an object belongs to. Commonly used techniques include Support vector machines, logistic regression, nearest neighbours and random forest.</li>
          <li><b>Regression</b>- In contrast regression algorithms predict a specific value based on the provided inputs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Unsupervised learning</b> - These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings in an unlabelled  datasets.  Their ability to 
        discover similarities and differences in information make them an ideal solution for many exploratory data analysis problems.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Clustering</b> - Automatically sorting similar objects into sets for applications such as customer segmentation using algorithms such as K-Means and spectral clustering </li>
          <li><b>Dimension reduction</b> - Reducing the number of random variables enables complex multidimensional data to be more easily visualised and reduces the computational cost of processing. 
            This approach forms the basis of collaborative filtering algorithms, used extensively in recommendation engine.</li>          
        </ul>
    </div>


    <h3 class="accordion">Deep learning techniques</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;"> 
        An artificial neural network (ANN) uses multiple layers between the inputs and outputs of a model to enable more complex relationships to be inferred. 
        While ANN's can be applied to all types of dataset, they truly excel when modelling complex entities such as images, sound and language, 
        where the significance of a piece of data is a function of the datapoints around it. Popular libraries for implementing deep learning models include 
        <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a>, developed by Google and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a> from Facebook.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/neutral-network-diagram.png" class="center">
      <p>The four main types of ANN we consider are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks</b> - Used extensively for image processing a CNN is able to reduce an image into a form suitable for processing, 
          without losing features which are critical for obtaining a good prediction. Passing the image through a range of filters and aggregating 
          the values assigned to cells enables low-level features such as edges, colour, gradient and orientation to be captured. These low-level features are then 
          combined in subsequent layers to obtain a high-level understanding of the image content. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b> - Analyse sequences of data and are used extensively for language processing and applications to interpret streamed IOT sensor data.  Pretrained libraries 
          such as <a href="https://spacy.io/">Spacy</a> provide powerful pretrained models that can be used to identify different parts of speech, sentiment and word similarity
          directly of a given piece of text.</p>
          <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b> - Is a behavioural machine learning model that, instead of being trained using sample data, learns to maximise reward through experimentation. 
            As the algorithm progressively learns the sequence of behaviours that return the most successful outcomes it devises a policy to deliver the optimal responce to a given situation.</li>  
        <li><b>Generative Adversarial Networks</b> - Discover and learn the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be 
          used to generate new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.  This technique has been used to translate photographs across domains, 
          such as day to night or summer to winter, generate high-resolution versions of input images or even create new music, images and texts in the style of a particular artist.
        </li>     
      </ul>
    </div>

      <div id="Objective" class="modal_container project1">
        <br>
        <p>Autonomous aircraft, requiring no human interventions during operation, is a rapidly evolving sector.
          The global autonomous aircraft market was estimated to be USD 4.56 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 16.23 billion by 2027.</p>
          
        <p>With such competition and growth potential manufacturers are looking towards enhanced service strategies as a means of delivering a competative advantage</p>
        <p>In responce to this opportunity we were commissioned to perform a comprehensive review intelligent health management solutions
          and develop a prototype solution utilising advanced analytics to demonstrate an approach to deliver adaptive vehicle health management, 
          providing greater process control, reduced operating costs and enhanced availability.
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div id="Hypothesis" class="modal_container project1">
        <br>
        <p>The approach taken involved decomposing this top-level objective into three targeted
          value propositions. 
          <ul>
            <li>Accurately predicting the remaining useful life of aircraft components based on the provided sensor data</li>
            <li>Providing dynamic fault diagnostics advice to the maintainer based on the observations</li>
            <li>Simulating the degradation of the aircraft and the potential maintenance decisions to determine the optimum responce 
              based on defined objective funcitons and within defined operational constraints.</li>
          </ul>

        <br>
      </div>

      <div id="Outcome" class="modal_container project1">
        <br>
        <p>Aviation will always mandate stringent safety requirements, however the ability to
          reduce uncertainty regarding the health of components presents an enormous
          opportunity to reduce cost and drive operational efficiencies.
        </p>
          The novel approach developd here, normalising the aircraft sensors data based on flight condition, to train a Long-Term-ShortTerm-Memory (LSTM) model  
          demonstrated the ability to predicting the degradation state of these complex systems, with supporting confidence intervals, and
          demonstrate how a move to a condition-based maintenance strategy could be realised. 
        </p>
        <p>The use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) provided the requried adaptive diagnostic advice to the
          maintainer in an intuitive and visual way.  This approach had the additional benefit of enabling any divergence from the designed system reliability</p>
        <p>
          Performing a monte-carlo analysis on the simulation combined with a dual annealing optimisation function enabled:
          <ul>
            <li>An optimised stocking policy to be proposed, based on both financial and aircraft availability constraints.</li>
            <li>Opportunity maintenance to be identified (proactively replacing an item early) to reduce cost and better utilise limited manpower and hangar capacity</li>

        <br>
        <p>An international accounting firm whose clients represent some of the worlds leading peforming artists had aspirations to provide increased clarity to their clients when managing their future revenue potential.</p>
        <p>
          The firm provided over 10 years of revenue information for a number of artists, which incorported revenues derived from streaming, perfoming, merchandise sales and syncronsiation rights (TV, movie, video games or advertising).
          The challenge set was to apply a varierty of analytical techniques to this data to enable more accurate and efficent revenue 
          forecasts to be generated when compared to the traditional approach being used.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Hypothesis2" class="modal_container project2">
        <br>
        <p>The approach taken involved:</p>

            <li>Developing a method to consolidate disparte records and identify key attributes into defined data structure suitable for analysis.</li> 
            <li>Assessing a varierty of machine learning, curve fitting and time series methodologies to predict future royalties</li>
            <li>Augment the existing data with additional publically available information to improve the predictive capability of the proposed solution</li>

      <div id="Outcome2" class="modal_container project2">
       <br>
        <p>From analysis at an individual song level the revenues generated were found to follow a decay curve, initially growing as the songs populatirty increased before begining to decline</p><br>
        <p>Using a modified version of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model#:~:text">Bass Diffusion Model</a>, used extensively for modelling future sales(shown below) we were able to accuratly fit the parameters in the equation for all the established songs in an artists catalogue</p>

        <p>The real challenge came in trying to predict future revenue for songs released in the last 6 months and therefore lacked the required historic information.  To overcome this problem we used the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a> to obtain charecterisics of the song and artist and 
          use them to train a model to predict the co-efficents of innovation and immitation.</p>
