    <h1>Developing a Data Platform</h1>
    <p>
      Data analysis can provide rich insights for an organisation, however the real value is only realised once these tools are made available to a wider user base.
      However it is estimated that only around 10% of machine learning models developed actually make it into production, and hence the real value is never realised.  
      The two main problems preventing wider adoption of analytical solutions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Unreliable source data </b> - While manual collection and bespoke data preparation can support isolated analysis a more robust data pipeline is required to allow an application to scale. 
        It is therefore essential to develop robust and validated data repositories to secure the data capture and preparation for the longer term.
      </li>
      <li><b>Accessibility</b> – If the developed solutions are not accessible and intuitive to prospective users their true value will never be realised.
          Furthermore, when providing services directly to your customers, it is essential that the look and feel of the application match the company values.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Developing an intuitive user interface (UI) for both the consumption and collection of data 
      is essential.  Validating data entry, managing access and permissions and providing 
      coherence with the wider corporate data warehouse strategy is essential.  
      As the business becomes more dependent on the applications the 
      code and models developed need to be reliable, maintainable and reproducible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this page we discuss some of the tools and software practices that should be used to ensure effective solutions are developed.

      <h2>Effective Development</h2>
      <img src="images/DevOps.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p>DevOps has become the software industry best practice way of working, combining cultural philosophies, practices, 
        and tools to develop and evolve applications faster and more reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its heart the objective is about crating flowing between the various process stages, represented by a figure of eight as shown in the diagram.
        Through improving communication and feedback, identify issues early and automating processes where possible to give the team the best possible chance of success.
      </p> 
      <p>We outline a few key concepts that should be understood, however for a more comprehensive account of DevOps practices refer to <a href"https://www.amazon.co.uk/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations-ebook/dp/B09G2GS39R/">The DevOps Handbook</a>.
      </p>
      

      <ul style="clear:both">
        <li><b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </b> - When developing a new application we always seek to produce something with enough features to get internal business users using the system or attract early-adopter customers with whom we can validate the  concepts early.  Once created we can then iteratively develop the capability learning from the feedback received.</li>
        <li><b>Agile </b> – When operating with a high degree of uncertainty traditional project management techniques don’t work.  Agile is an approach to project management in which small 2-3 week sprints of activity are planned, each of which deliver demonstrable capability, which can be tested with the user.</li>
        <li><b>Version control systems</b> - such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> provide a means of storing, sharing and tracking changes to source code in a special kind of database. This repository is an invaluable source of that needs to be protected from both catastrophic events and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.</li>
        <li><b>Code Formatting</b>  While the software your code communicates with doesn’t care how the code looks, other developers who may have to work on it in the future certainly do. When everyone is writing code that looks the same, your brain can relax a bit as the understanding comes faster.  Using opinionated formating tools, like <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Black</a> can enforce rules automatically to simplify the process of writing well structured code.</li>
        <li><b>Testing</b> - is fundemental to ensure good quality code is being written and allows changes to be quickly validated  The main types of testing used are:
          <ul>
            <li>Unit Testing - refers to taking a component of a program and testing it in isolation by writing functionally independent components unit tests can be easily automated to validate changes, test dependancies and handeling of edge cases.</li>
            <li>Functional Testing - checks the compliance of the system overall against a defined set of criteria. In other words does the software as a whole do what it’s supposed to do?</li>
            <li>Regression Testing - running previously written tests whenever a new change is introduced to the code allowing you to remain confident that your code continues to function as expected as it grows in complexity and capability.</li>
          </ul>
          
           
          

        <li><b>Continuous integration</b> – is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated tests validate the code quality.  A robust approach to ensure good test coverage enables bugs to be found quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.</li>
        <li><b>MLOPS</b>– Extends the concept of DevOps to machine learning models where integration not only covers testing and validating code but is now extended to test and validate the data in the system including the retraining and serving of models as required.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="Data_Architecture" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2>Structuring your data</h2>
      <p>3 terms are often used when talking about data storage:</p>

      <h4>Data Lake</h4>
      <p>
        Contains raw data, of various formats, in its native form
      </p>
  
      <h4>Data Warehouse</h4>
      <p>
        A Data warehouse is a central repository that merges information from different sources and consolidates it through the extract, transform and load process, 
        also known as ETL process, into a comprehensive database used  for analytical and business techniques. At a very high level, the ETL process extracts the data from 
        multiple sources, transforms it into a cleaned format to be used for business processes, and finally loads that data into the data repository. 
        A data warehouse stores current data and the historical information that has been cleansed, conform categorized. When data gets loaded into the data warehouse, 
        it is modelled and structured, ready for a specific purpose.
      </p>
      <h4>Data Marts</h4>
      <p>
        Data Marts can be created in 3 different ways all of which aim to provide the requried data to the end-users and make it accessible to the wider organisation. These data marts accelerate the business process and offer a cost and time-efficient way to take the data-driven decision.
        <ul>
          <li>Dependent data marts - built by drawing data from the existing central warehouse generally used for isolated security and solo performance.</li>
          <li>Independent data marts - Created by drawing from operational or external data sources normally used to capture business or customer data that would otherwise reside with individuals and be inaccessible to the wider organisation. </li>
          <li>Hybrid data mart - combines input from a data warehouse, operational systems and external systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Types of database</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>SQL - </li>
          <li>NOSQL - </li>
          <li>Graph - </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>


      <div id="WebApps" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
        <h2>Designing a solution</h2>
        <img src="images/MVC.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
        <p>When building applications the main objective is to make the functionality and data contained within it available to a 
          range of users, both internal and external to the organisation.  Web apps provide secure access to a range of users over the Internet through their web browser.  
          This ability to  avoid the need to install specialist software on peoples devices, allowing all updates to be deployed remotely and centralising the data store 
          make WebApps an ideal solution for most applications.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is a really useful Python library that enables simple WebApps to be produced without any front end web development, 
          making them an ideal means of sharing analytical models across an internal team.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more complex solutions a more traditional approach to building applications will be requried, splitting the functionality across server and client side processing.
          For the majoirty of applications we favour a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, which balances the benefits of inrtoducing a separation of concerns between the frontend and backend components 
          while avoiding some of the complexity utilising microservices can cause.
        </p>
        
        <p> The use of Application Programming Interfaces (API's) allows a programme to be broken into distinct services that communicates with other services through a well-defined interface such as an API.  This approach allows areas of the code to be developed in parallel and minimises the risk of unintended consequences so long as the interfaces between services are maintained.
       
        <p>
          Following  the user interface, which is controlled using a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript runs in the browser, 
          whereas the business logic, authentication and interaction with the databases occurs on the server side.  In the following section we explore our prefered technology stack when building tehse applications.
        </p> 
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>Model</b> - The backend that contains all the data logic</li>
          <li><b>View </b> – The frontend or graphical user interface (GUI)</li>
          <li><b>Controller</b> – The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Application Programming Interface (API)</b>) –In computer programming a guiding design principle is to introduce Separation of concerns (SoC).  Breaking the programme into distinct services that communicates with other services through a well-defined interface such as an API.  This approach allows areas of the code to be developed in parallel and minimises the risk of unintended consequences so long as the interfaces between services are maintained.

      <br>






      <div id="Tech_Stack" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
        <h2>Selecting the tools</h2>
        <p>
          The options when selecting the languages, libraries and frameworks with which to develop an 
          application can be overwhelming. While specific applications may necessarily drive towards different solutions it is 
          useful to default stack that can guarantee affordability, supportability, reliability, and security.  
        </p>
        <p>
          In the context of supporting data driven digital transformation the ability to incorporate machine learning models and analysis (detailed in the ANALYSE section of site) is paramount.  
          We therefore look to use a Python framework to write our backend processes, maximising the ability to reuse code and minimising the breadth of knowledge required to manage these developed solutions.
        </p> 
        <p>
          Another key consideration is to select popular open-source frameworks for which there is a rich source of training materials and support while avoiding costly licence fees.  
          For these reasons, our default stack uses Django, React and PostgreSQL, which collectively provide a highly capable and supportable solution.  
        </p>  

          
        <p>A brief outline of each of these is provided below.</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li><b>PostgreSQL</b> – provide a highly capable database to store the required data.  It supports a wide variety of data types, provides integrity controls to prevent invalid or orphan records and powerful indexing methods to optimize performance.  Advanced features such as full-text search speed up finding information and the ability to store non-relational data such as JSON and XML formats actually turns PostgreSQL into NoSQL database providing the flexibility to meet a the evolving requirements of your applications.</li>
          <li><b>Django</b> - is a Python backend (server-side framework) able to integrate easily with existing analytical and machine learning models.  Django provides a host of built in advanced functionality such as admin panels, file upload support, authentication, comment boxes, contact forms, app management and a versatile toolkit for constructing web APIs to significantly reduce the time and effort in building robust web applications.</li>
          <li><b>React </b> – is a JavaScript frontend (client-side framework used to build single page User Interfaces (UI).   getting and setting data via requests to the Django backend.  As with Django, React comes with multiple component libraries, add-on packages and full template offerings to save developers a lot of time capable of producing engaging and intuitive user interfaces.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>

      
      <div id="Hosting" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
        <h2>Choosing a Hosting Environment</h2>
        <p>There are fundamentally two types of hosting arrangement available.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Statically hosting</b>- enables web pages serve up the same page to HTML, CSS and JavaScript to all users who enter the site, in reality this is nothing more than a file store.  As no processing is required on the server these pages are generally faster and can be hosted at minimal, or no, cost using a variety of service providers including our favourite GitHub Pages.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Dynamic hosting</b> -enables the processing of content and storage of data on the server.  Dynamic hosting can be provided on any corporate network or by a cloud 
          service provider however these services can become complex to manage.  If you have a team already set, up to configure and manage servers these options provide the 
          greatest flexibility however they can be difficult to manage and control cost if you don’t have the prerequisite skills. 
          <p>An alternative solution is to opt for a PaaS (platform as a service) offering a more managed, low configuration services, making it incredibly easy to get up and running 
            and provide total upfront transparency of the costs. Our favoured solution is to use Heroku, which comes with the added benefit of providing a “Free Tier” which, while 
            there are significant constraints in terms of speed and storage capacity, provides an ideal sandpit environment in which to demonstrate capability without commitment.

          <br>
          <p>Autonomous aircraft, requiring no human interventions during operation, is a rapidly evolving sector.
            The global autonomous aircraft market was estimated to be USD 4.56 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 16.23 billion by 2027.</p>
            
          <p>With such competition and growth potential manufacturers are looking towards enhanced service strategies as a means of delivering a competative advantage</p>
          <p>In responce to this opportunity we were commissioned to perform a comprehensive review intelligent health management solutions
            and develop a prototype solution utilising advanced analytics to demonstrate an approach to deliver adaptive vehicle health management, 
            providing greater process control, reduced operating costs and enhanced availability.
          </p>
          <br>
        </div>
  
        <div id="Hypothesis" class="modal_container project1">
          <br>
          <p>The approach taken involved decomposing this top-level objective into three targeted
            value propositions. 
            <ul>
              <li>Accurately predicting the remaining useful life of aircraft components based on the provided sensor data</li>
              <li>Providing dynamic fault diagnostics advice to the maintainer based on the observations</li>
              <li>Simulating the degradation of the aircraft and the potential maintenance decisions to determine the optimum responce 
                based on defined objective funcitons and within defined operational constraints.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
        </div>
  
        <div id="Outcome" class="modal_container project1">
          <br>
          <p>Aviation will always mandate stringent safety requirements, however the ability to
            reduce uncertainty regarding the health of components presents an enormous
            opportunity to reduce cost and drive operational efficiencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel approach developd here, normalising the aircraft sensors data based on flight condition, to train a Long-Term-ShortTerm-Memory (LSTM) model  
            demonstrated the ability to predicting the degradation state of these complex systems, with supporting confidence intervals, and
            demonstrate how a move to a condition-based maintenance strategy could be realised. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) provided the requried adaptive diagnostic advice to the
            maintainer in an intuitive and visual way.  This approach had the additional benefit of enabling any divergence from the designed system reliability</p>
          <p>
            Performing a monte-carlo analysis on the simulation combined with a dual annealing optimisation function enabled:
            <ul>
              <li>An optimised stocking policy to be proposed, based on both financial and aircraft availability constraints.</li>
              <li>Opportunity maintenance to be identified (proactively replacing an item early) to reduce cost and better utilise limited manpower and hangar capacity</li>
