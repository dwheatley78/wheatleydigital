    <h1>Generating Value Through Actionable Insights</h1>
    <p>The boxes below provide a very brief outline of some of the types of analysis we can perform.  
      For examples of projects we have completed click on the links in the <a href="#home-tiles">project portfolio</a> section of this page</p>

    <div style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Mathematical modelling</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Machine learning is the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn 
        without direct instruction. This enables a computer system to continue learning and improving on its own, based on experience. 
        Machine learning covers a wide variety of techniques that can support a range of different requirements. 
      </p>
 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Optimization and decision models</b> - Identify the optimum solution given known behaviours and constraints.</li>
          <li><b>Econometrics</b> - Inference and predictions discovering cause-and-effect relationships in data to estimate, test and evaluate relationships</li>
          <li><b>Network Analytics</b> Graphs provide a way to represent the relationships between interconnected objects.  Companies such as google search engine 
            make extensive use of networks to infer the importance a relevance of a internet sites, SatNav systems use networks to plan optimised routes between locations and Facebook 
            uses networks to infer the level of connectivity and influence between individuals.</li>
          <li><b>Time series analysis</b> (ARIMA and ETS) to project forward the observed seasonality  and underlying trends to predict future events given the past</li>
          <li><b>Discreet Event Simulation</b> - </li>

        </ul>

    </div>
    <br>
    
    <div style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Machine learning techniques</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">Machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification and focus on making the best fit instead of 
        understanding  causality.
        An Error Function serves to evaluate the quality of a model prediction to which weights are then adjusted to reduce 
        the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize process, updating 
        weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.  
      </p>
 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Supervised learning</b>- The models use a labelled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately.</li>
          <li><b>Unsupervised learning</b> uses algorithms to analyse and cluster unlabelled  datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis</li>
          <li><b>Semi-supervised learning</b> - uses a smaller labelled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabelled data set</li>
        </ul>
        
      

    </div>
 
    <br>
    <div style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Deep learning techniques</h2>
      <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;"> A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers 
        enabling complexity relationships to be inferred.  While DNN's can be applied to all types of dataset the majority of the use cases involve modelling complex relationships
        such as images, sound and language where the significance of a piece of data is a function of the datapoints around it. 
      </p>
 
      <ul>
        <li><b>Convolutional Neural Networks</b> Used extensively for image processing to perform classification and even develop generative algorithms.</li>
        <li><b>Natural Language Processing</b> - Speech recognition enables a computer system to identify words in spoken language, and natural language understanding recognises meaning in written or spoken language and identify and categorise positive, neutral and negative sentiment in text.</li>
        <li><b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b> to perform classification and even develop generative algorithms.</li>
        <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b> is a behavioural machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. 
          A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.
        </li>     
      </ul>
        
      <p>All of which can be performed with statistical confidence levels.</p>

      <div id="Objective" class="modal_container project1">
        <br>
        <p>Autonomous aircraft, requiring no human interventions during operation, is a rapidly evolving sector.
          The global autonomous aircraft market was estimated to be USD 4.56 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 16.23 billion by 2027.</p>
          
        <p>With such competition and growth potential manufacturers are looking towards enhanced service strategies as a means of delivering a competative advantage</p>
        <p>In responce to this opportunity we were commissioned to perform a comprehensive review intelligent health management solutions
          and develop a prototype solution utilising advanced analytics to demonstrate an approach to deliver adaptive vehicle health management, 
          providing greater process control, reduced operating costs and enhanced availability.
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div id="Hypothesis" class="modal_container project1">
        <br>
        <p>The approach taken involved decomposing this top-level objective into three targeted
          value propositions. 
          <ul>
            <li>Accurately predicting the remaining useful life of aircraft components based on the provided sensor data</li>
            <li>Providing dynamic fault diagnostics advice to the maintainer based on the observations</li>
            <li>Simulating the degradation of the aircraft and the potential maintenance decisions to determine the optimum responce 
              based on defined objective funcitons and within defined operational constraints.</li>
          </ul>

        <br>
      </div>

      <div id="Outcome" class="modal_container project1">
        <br>
        <p>Aviation will always mandate stringent safety requirements, however the ability to
          reduce uncertainty regarding the health of components presents an enormous
          opportunity to reduce cost and drive operational efficiencies.
        </p>
          The novel approach developd here, normalising the aircraft sensors data based on flight condition, to train a Long-Term-ShortTerm-Memory (LSTM) model  
          demonstrated the ability to predicting the degradation state of these complex systems, with supporting confidence intervals, and
          demonstrate how a move to a condition-based maintenance strategy could be realised. 
        </p>
        <p>The use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) provided the requried adaptive diagnostic advice to the
          maintainer in an intuitive and visual way.  This approach had the additional benefit of enabling any divergence from the designed system reliability</p>
        <p>
          Performing a monte-carlo analysis on the simulation combined with a dual annealing optimisation function enabled:
          <ul>
            <li>An optimised stocking policy to be proposed, based on both financial and aircraft availability constraints.</li>
            <li>Opportunity maintenance to be identified (proactively replacing an item early) to reduce cost and better utilise limited manpower and hangar capacity</li>
          </ul>

      <div id="Objective2" class="modal_container project2">
        <br>
        <p>An international accounting firm whose clients represent some of the worlds leading peforming artists had aspirations to provide increased clarity to their clients when managing their future revenue potential.</p>
        <p>
          The firm provided over 10 years of revenue information for a number of artists, which incorported revenues derived from streaming, perfoming, merchandise sales and syncronsiation rights (TV, movie, video games or advertising).
          The challenge set was to apply a varierty of analytical techniques to this data to enable more accurate and efficent revenue 
          forecasts to be generated when compared to the traditional approach being used.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="Hypothesis2" class="modal_container project2">
        <br>
        <p>The approach taken involved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developing a method to consolidate disparte records and identify key attributes into defined data structure suitable for analysis.</li> 
            <li>Assessing a varierty of machine learning, curve fitting and time series methodologies to predict future royalties</li>
            <li>Augment the existing data with additional publically available information to improve the predictive capability of the proposed solution</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="Outcome2" class="modal_container project2">
       <br>
        <p>From analysis at an individual song level the revenues generated were found to follow a decay curve, initially growing as the songs populatirty increased before begining to decline</p><br>
        <p>Using a modified version of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model#:~:text">Bass Diffusion Model</a>, used extensively for modelling future sales(shown below) we were able to accuratly fit the parameters in the equation for all the established songs in an artists catalogue</p>
        <img src="images/bass_model1.png" width=175px><img src="images/bass_model.png" width=175px>
        
        <p>The real challenge came in trying to predict future revenue for songs released in the last 6 months and therefore lacked the required historic information.  To overcome this problem we used the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a> to obtain charecterisics of the song and artist and 
          use them to train a model to predict the co-efficents of innovation and immitation.</p>
