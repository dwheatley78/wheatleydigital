    <p>
      A digital transformation is about exploiting technology to redefine your business model, accentuating your strengths, overcoming weaknesses, exploiting opportunities and 
      mitigating potential threats to deliver competitive advantage.  When evaluating what your future "digitally enabled"  business model should look like, it may be helpful to consider how a start-up would 
      disrupt your existing business model through either:
    </p>        
    <ul>
      <li>Using digital technology to deliver the services you currently offer more effectively.</li>
      <li>Fundamentally change the cost structure of the business, free from the constraints of legacy processes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/business_model.png" alt="business model"class="smlscr_image right_image">
    
    
    <p>
      Whether your digital transformation aims to enhance internal processes, or offer new services to your customers, it is essential to constantly check that the 3 key tenants of 
      innovation are being satisfied: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Desirability</b> - What do customers and internal business users want?</li>
      <li><b>Viability</b> - What can be financially justified both independently and in support of wider business objectives?</li>
      <li><b>Feasibility</b> - What is technically and organisationally possible?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The sections below outline the <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> approach to developing effective digital transformation strategies.

      We outline how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> can help build your digital capability in the <a href="./production.html"> Productionise </a> and <a href="./analysis.html"> Analyse</a> 
      pages of this site.  However, the key to a successful digital transformation is ensuring you are tackling the right issues, engaging the team and building solutions that work.  
      As you start your digital transformation journey it is essential that you remain focussed on: 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Performance</b> - Be clear what is the challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure that the developed solutions are of real value to the business.</li>
      <li><b>Interventions</b> - Know what levers you can pull and understand the interdependencies between technology, people, processes and organisation structure in defining the future state.</li>
      <li><b>People</b> - Actively involve the team to gain a rich understanding of their issues and involve them in defining solutions to 
        overcome the adoption issues that blight many traditional transformation programmes</li>
      <li><b>Data and technology</b> - Only once armed with a clear understanding of the above should you start to look at what analytical tools can be used to deliver the required
        improvements, the data they require and how it should be captured and stored</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Another consideration before you begin is to understand if a well configured customer relationship management (CRM) and/or enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool could best serve your needs.
      If you are interested in implementing a CRM and/or ERP system, both <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, 
      provide very capable, but expensive solutions.  As a more affordable solution we recommend considering  <a href="https://www.dolibarr.org/" target="_blank">Dolibar</a> as a great open-source alternative.

    <p>
      In the next section we will outline how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> develop high impact solutions that deliver value for your organisation fast!

    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion">Driving innovation</h3>
      <div class="panel">
        <br/>
        <img src="images/design challenge.png" alt="design challenge" class="right_image smlscr_image">
        <p style="clear:left">
          To frame the objective of your digital transformation programme we suggest writing a well-defined design challenge, using the template shown. 
          This design challenge ensures that developed solutions are based on a solid understanding the needs of the user.  We then use a process of "Design Thinking" to break down the 
          traditional barriers to innovation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Conventionality</b>– Using conventional techniques to solve problems results in conventional solutions.  To be truly innovative new ways of working are needed. 
            Design Thinking provides an approach to engage diverse voices from across the organisation to develop a rich understanding of the problem to be addressed.</li>
          <li><b>Risk Adversity</b> – In a risk adverse culture the tendency is to kill off novel and innovative ideas in favour of safer and better understood solutions.  Design thinking promotes a culture of experimentation and failing fast to ensure novel solutions get properly explored. </li>
          <li><b>Ownership</b>- An innovation won’t succeed unless the company employees get behind it. Design Thinking provides a methodology to involve people in the process of generating ideas, winning support and ensuring ownership of the developed solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>  
          The book, <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design" target="_blank">Value Proposition Design</a> by Alexander Osterwalder breaks the Design Thinking Process into 5 discrete phases and proposes a range of techniques to be used. 
          As experienced Design Thinking facilitators <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> can lead members of your team through these 
          phases in a series of fun and engaging workshops 
          to elicit user centric requirements, develop solutions that work and importantly ensure commitment to change from across the organisation.
        </p>      
        <ul>
          <li><b>Empathise</b> -  Immersion in the customer experience to develop empathy and an understanding of their needs.</li>
          <li><b>Define</b> - These ideas are then consolidated and refined to define a clear problem statement.</li>
          <li><b>Ideate</b> – Potential solutions are then explored, challenging assumptions and looking at the problem from new angles.</li>
          <li><b>Prototype</b> – Examines the proposed solutions in more detail through the development of low fidelity models.</li>
          <li><b>Test</b> -  Using these models the team then test their assumptions to better understand how users would interact with the solution.</li>
        </ul>

      The key to a successful digital transformation programme is ensuring the focus remains on delivering value, looking at the 
      whole ecosystem and <b>not</b> solely on the technology you wish to deploy</b>. 
      Our expertise in delivering discovery-based digital transformation programmes ensures:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interdependencies between technology, people and processes are actively managed</li>

      <a href="./analysis.html">analytical</a> capabilities <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> can help you develop;
      it is important to understand what your existing IT systems can provide.</p>
    <p>
      For many businesses the adoption of, or improvement to, a customer relationship management (CRM) and/or enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool could be the best first step.

      <img src="images/BML-Loop.png" alt="build model learn" class="smlscr_image right_image" style="width:350px">

          <p>The process of testing assumptions with users and validating that the proposed solution meets their requirements doesn't stop with the creation of a prototype. 
            In his book, <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> Eric Ries describes a process, that aligns well with the discovery-based 
            digital transformation philosophy.  He suggests, when building a new product or service you should start with a minimum viable product (MVP), providing just enough functionality to 
            encourage a small cohort of users to adopt 
           the solution and then, with these "early-adopters" a cycle of designing experiments, testing hypotheses, measuring the response, and learning from the results, 
           referred to as a "Build-Measure-Learn" loop, is defined.  As the results come in from these experiments you can then evaluate the appropriate course of action, either: 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Persevere</b>: Your hypothesis was correct, so you decide to press on with the same goals. You repeat the feedback 
                loop to continuously improve and refine your idea.
              </li>
              <li><b>Pivot</b>: The experiment has refuted your hypothesis, but you've still gained valuable knowledge about what doesn't
                work. You can reset, or correct your course and repeat the loop, using what you've learned to test new hypotheses and carry out different experiments.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p> 
            Through repeating this loop and continuously evaluating how to respond you are able quickly iterate and refine your offering, 
            enabling you to cost-effectively deliver precisely what your users want. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Web analytics provide a powerful tool to track user activity on your site and develop a rich understanding of their interactions. 
             A/B testing is then a way to perform experiments, offering subtly different experiences to different cohorts of users and looking 
            for statistically significant differences between them to help shape the optimum solution. 
            Google provides a range of tools that simplify the process of monitoring user behaviour and performing experiments, check out the 
            <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/" target="_blank">Analytics Academy</a> website for more information.

      <p>
        Any process is only as good as the people who operate it.  As your business becomes more digital the demands on your employees may change.
        To support them in this transition it may be necessary to invest in training to 
        enable them to adapt and excel in a new working environment.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to redefining existing roles a range of new capabilities will also be required in order to deliver and sustain your digital transformation.
        While the long-term objective should be to develop these skills internally, you're probably going to need a hand to get started.
        With experienced practitioners across all 7 key digital transformation disciplines, <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> offer a unique capability to both

    <h3 class="accordion">Digital presence</h3>
      <div class="panel">
      <br/>
        <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">
          Once up and running the challenge is then to give your site an identity that people will recognise and get them to start using it.
        </p>
   
        <h4>Selecting a name</h4>
        <p>An often overlooked consideration, when building Web Apps, is ensuring the identity and brand 
          they present align with the company values you are trying to portray.  
          One of the key channels for presenting an identity is the web address with which people will access your service from their browser.   
          This address should be both memorable and relevant and can be achieved through using one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>New top-level domain</b> - Securing a dedicated top level <code>.com</code> domain name (TLD) can be challenging and expensive, but 
            the recent growth of new TLD options such as <code>.digital</code> allow you to explore more creative and descriptive options.</li>
          <li><b>Subdomain</b> - Websites normally use the subdomain <code>www.</code> but additional subdomains can be used to access your new service.  
            e.g.  <code>https://maps.google.com</code></li>
          <li><b>Subdirectory</b> -  a subdirectory from your existing  domain can also be used, as in <code>https://www.google.com/maps</code></li>
        </ul>


      <h4>Creating an identity</h4>
      <p>Another key channel is the logo used for your site which will feature prominently in the header of the website, on the user's 
        browser as a favicon and as an icon on their home screens, it may even be used on marketing literature to promote your service. When selecting a logo there are four main principals 
        that should guide your selection: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Appropriateness</b> - The logo should convey your brand message to the target audience.</li>
        <li><b>Simplicity</b> - A minimal and simple logo tends to attract people more easily.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability</b> - The logo design should work whether it is the size from a tiny favicon to a giant billboard.</li>
        <li><b>Timelessness</b> - It takes time to gain brand recognition, so choose a design that will last. </li>
      </ul>     
      <p>
        Equally important is a consistent look and feel across your application, which will both improve the user experience and support your brand identity. 
        CSS frameworks, such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> enable professional and highly responsive websites with 
        standardised icons, buttons and navigation components to be created with relative ease.
        While for more advanced applications design systems, such as <a href="https://material.io/" target="_blank">Material Design</a> by Google, 
        provide more sophistication, introducing state management and interactivity to make controls feel tactile and responsive. 
      </p>

      <h4>Digital Marketing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</b> - is the process of optimising websites so that they rank well on search engines through organic (non-paid) search. 
          A search engine works by matching the user search query with information ascertained from the site meta descriptions, titles, loading speeds, links and keywords 
          to determine the order in which they appear. By structuring your site well, you can increase the likelihood of it being prioritised in the results. 
          For more information check out the 
          Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide" target="_blank">SEO starter guide</a>
        </li>
      


      <li><b>Paid Search</b> - To rank well on more generic search keywords it will be necessary to invest in paid search advertisements. 
        Paid search works on a pay-per-click model, meaning you only pay when somebody accesses your site from the displayed advert.
     
        The rate you pay for a click varies based on the keywords you select, with more popular terms being considerably more expensive. 
        For more information the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6146252"><span>Google Ads</span></a> site provides a useful guide to developing your advertising campaign.
        <p>
          When developing your adverts it is important to ensure that the clicks you receive result in conversions, in the form of sales, contact form submissions or other 
          metrics that are important to your business.  By setting up your advertising properly you can ensure you target specific users, then using website analystics you can track their
          activity to measure the effectiveness of your campaign.
        </p>
