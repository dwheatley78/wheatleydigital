    <h1>Developing a Data Platform</h1>
    <p>
      Data analysis can provide rich insights for an organisation; however, the real value is only realised once these tools are made available to a wider user community. 
      It is estimated that only around 10% of machine learning models developed actually make it into production, and hence the real value is never realised. 
      The two main issues preventing wider adoption are: 
      <ul>
        <li><b>Unreliable source data </b> - While manual collection and bespoke data preparation can support isolated analysis, a more robust data pipeline is required to allow an application to scale. 
          It is therefore essential to develop robust and validated data repositories to secure the data capture and preparation process for their longer-term success.
        </li>
        <li><b>Accessibility</b> – If the developed solutions are not accessible or intuitive to prospective users their true value will never be realised.
            Furthermore, when providing services directly to your customers, it is essential that the look and feel of the application matches the company values you wish to portray.
        </li>
      </ul>    
    </p>
    <p>
      In sections below we explain how <span id="brand">EMPEDATA</span> develop applications development solves both of these issues and address the following guiding principles.
      Alternatively <a href="./contact.html">get in touch</a> to arrange a private discussion to discover how we can support
      you and your Digital Transformation.<p>
    </p>  
    <img src="images/webapp_cats.png" class="center">
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Affordability</b> - Avoid expensive licence fees by using freely available open-source tools.</li>
        <li><b>Maintainability</b> - Ensure code is well documented and written using popular, well-supported, programming languages.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability</b> - Solutions should be designed with growth in mind, ensuring they can continue to satisfy your longer-term digital aspirations.</li>
        <li><b>Usability</b> - User interfaces (UI) must be intuitive, engaging and provide the necessary data validation.</li>      
        <li><b>Security</b> - Data must be stored securely and robust access and permission management needs to be provided by the application.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    

    <h3 class="accordion">Designing an application</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>
      <img src="images/MVC.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p>
        Web Apps can provide functionality and secure data access to a variety of users through their web browsers 
        without the need to install specialist software, allowing updates to be easily deployed and centralising the data storage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For simple analytical applications the <a href="https://streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> library enables web apps to be created entirely using Python
        without the need for separate front end web development.  This is a simple, low-cost solution for sharing analytical models amongst an internal team however it 
        is unable to deliver the functionality required by more demanding applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the majority of our data platform applications we use a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture which provides an appropriate balance between complexity and 
        control by introducing some separation of concerns between the three core elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Model</b> - The backend that contains all the data logic.</li>
        <li><b>View </b> – The frontend or graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
        <li><b>Controller</b> – The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Our preferred web development framework for server-side applications is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
        Django is a Python library, simplifying the integration with existing analytical/machine learning models, as discussed on the <a href="./analysis.html">Analyse</a> page, 
        and provides built-in functionality such as admin panels, file upload support, authentication, contact forms and app management which all significantly 
        reduces the time and effort required to build robust 
        web applications.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances if can be beneficial to further separate the UI and data processing elements of the application using an Application Programming Interface (API). 
        APIs allow a programme to be broken into distinct services, enabling them to be developed in parallel with minimal risk of unintended consequences, so long as the interfaces 
        between services are maintained. To support this approach Django provides a versatile toolkit for constructing web APIs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend (client-side) functionality of web application is provided using JavaScript for which a variety of frameworks exist.  
        These frameworks enable developers to take advantage of pre-existing functionality and templates, reducing development time and increasing software quality.
         <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> is currently the most used front-end web application framework with a focus on developing common reusable UI components to deliver engaging 
        and intuitive user interfaces and ensure consistency across all applications.
      </p>

    <h3 class="accordion">Effective Development</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>    
      <img src="images/DevOps.png" class="smlscr_image right_image">
      <p>
        Equally as important as the applications construction are the processes used to build and deploy the service.
        In the last 10 years DevOps has established itself as software industry best practice, combining cultural philosophies, methodologies, 
        and tools to develop and evolve applications faster and more reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its heart DevOps is about creating flow between the various process stages, represented by the figure of eight shown.
        Through improving communication and feedback, identifying issues early and automating processes where possible to give the team the best possible chance of success.
      </p> 
      <p>We outline a few key concepts that should be understood, however for a more comprehensive account of DevOps practices we recommend
        <a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-devops-handbook/"  target="_blank">The DevOps Handbook</a> by Gene Kim.
      </p>
      

      <ul style="clear:both">
        <li><b>Agile </b> – When operating in a development environment, where there is a high degree of uncertainty, traditional project management techniques don’t work.  Agile, as defined in more detail in the book
          <a href="https://www.scruminc.com/new-scrum-the-book/" target="_blank">Scrum The Art of Doing Twice The Work In Half the Time</a>, is an approach to project management 
          in which small 2-3 week sprints of activity are planned, each of which delivers a demonstrable package of capability.
        </li>
        <li><b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </b> - When developing a new application, it is key to produce something with just enough functionality to encourage users 
          to adopt the solution.  These users can then be used to support the iterative development of new functionality, testing enhancements and enabling the developers to learn from the feedback received.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Version control systems</b> - Systems such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> provide a means of storing, sharing and tracking changes to source 
          code in a special kind of database. This repository is an invaluable source of information that needs to be protected from both catastrophic events and the casual degradation by 
          human error.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Code Formatting</b>  While software doesn’t care how the code looks, other developers who may have to work on it in the future 
          certainly do. When everyone is writing code that looks the same, it becomes easier to understand and amend.  Opinionated formatting tools 
          can be used to enforce styling rules and simplifies the process of writing well-structured code.</li>
        <li><b>Testing</b> - is fundamental to ensure good quality code is being written and allows changes to be quickly validated.  The main types of testing are:
          <ul>
            <li>Unit Testing - refers to taking a component of a program and testing it in isolation, these tests can then be 
              automated to validate changes,  test dependencies and handling of edge cases.</li>
            <li>Functional Testing - checks the compliance of the overall system against a defined set of criteria. In other words, does the software do what it’s 
              supposed to do?</li>
            <li>Regression Testing - running previously written tests whenever a new change is introduced to confirm it continues to function as expected.</li>
          </ul>
          
           
          

        <li><b>Continuous integration</b> – is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, 
          after which automated tests validate the code quality.  A robust approach to integration ensures bugs are found quicker 
          and reduces the time it takes to release software updates.</li>
        <li><b>MLOPS</b>– Extends the concept of DevOps to machine learning models where integration not only covers testing and validating code, but is now extended to test 
          and validate the data in the system, including the retraining and serving of models as required.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion">Structuring your data</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>   
      <p>The objective of a good data architecture is to ensure that all the information required to run your business is accurate, consistent and accessible.
        The first step in this process is often ensure that key information is stored centrally instead of distributed across a variety of personal computers 
        and drives.  Storing raw data, of various formats, in its native form in one common location is known as a <b>Data Lake</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Having created a <b>Data Lake</b>, it will probably become apparent that different, contradictory, versions of the same data exist and require significant work
        to convert it into a format suitable for analysis. To manage this situation it is necessary to create a process for extracting the data from multiple sources, 
        transforming it into a cleaned format and loading it into a structured database, called a <b>Data Warehouse</b>.  This process of transforming and storing the data 
        in a format optimised for a specific business purpose is commonly referred to as an ETL process.
      </p>
      <p>The problem arises as new unstructured data needs to be ingested into the <b>Data Warehouse</b>. 
        The solution is to build an application, as defined above, to collect and validate the data at the point of entry. This data is then stored in a dedicated database, 
        known as a <b>Data Mart</b>, which in turn forms a component of the wider <b>Data Warehouse</b> capability. Depending on the data requirements of the application the <b>Data Mart</b> 
        may be considered as either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Independent - Created by drawing from operational or external data sources which would otherwise 
          reside with individuals and be inaccessible to the wider organisation.
        </li>
        <li>Hybrid - combines input from a <b>Data Warehouse</b>, operational systems and external systems</li>
        <li>Dependent - built by drawing data from the existing central warehouse generally used for enhanced security and performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ultimately, the data being collected needs to be stored in a database; for which there are a variety of choices available, each with their own 
        strengths and limitations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relational databases are the standard solution, providing a strict structure/schema, ensuring the data they contain satisfies a predefined list of components, 
          making it easily accessible and significantly reducing the chance of errors.
        </li>
        <li>Non-relational databases are more forgiving in their structure. Instead of tables with columns and rows, they have collections made from different 
          categories allowing records of varying shape to be stored. 

        </li>
        <li>Graph databases are a relatively new form of database that capture both the entities and relationships between the different data points. These databases 
          rose to prominence with the growth of network analytics, as used extensively by Facebook and Google. 
        </li>          
      </ul>
      <p> 
        A combination of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>
        satisfy the requirements of all web application data platforms.  They both satisfy all of the 5 tool selection 
        criteria outlined at the top of this page and can be easily integrated with Django. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database graph database and is capable of providing fast high integrity graph storage.  
          It comes with a dedicated query language that provides fast read and write performance and wealth of training materials to help you get started. 
        </li>
        <li>
          PostgreSQL is a hybrid database, while traditionally considered as a relational database, Postgres has recently included the ability to store 
          JSON and XML data formats, which provides the required NOSQL capabilities. Additional strengths of PostgreSQL include integrity controls that 
          can prevent invalid or orphan records and high performance through advanced indexing and full-text search methods. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion">Choosing a Hosting Environment</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <br/>   
        <p>There are fundamentally two types of hosting arrangement available.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Statically hosting</b> - enables web pages to serve up the same HTML, CSS and JavaScript to all users who enter the site.
            As no processing is required on the server these pages are generally faster and can be hosted at minimal or no cost.
        </p> 
        <p><b>Dynamic hosting</b> - enables the processing of content and storage of data on the server.  Dynamic hosting can be provided on any corporate network or by a cloud 
          service provider.  If you already have an IT team  capable of setting up, configuring and managing servers this option provides the 
          greatest flexibility.
        </p>
        
        <p>An alternative solution is to opt for a PaaS (platform as a service) which offers a more managed, low configuration service, making it incredibly easy to get up and running 
          and provides total upfront transparency of costs. Our favoured solution is to use <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, which comes with the added benefit of providing a “Free Tier” which, while 
          there are significant constraints in terms of speed and storage capacity, provides an ideal sandpit environment in which to demonstrate capability without commitment.
